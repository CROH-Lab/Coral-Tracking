# Coral-Tracking
This is a tracking sheet to view live data related to coral health, water quality parameters, and standing genetic diversity of several endangered, threatened, and under-studied coral species.

### Current Stock
The Coral Reef and Ocean Health Research Group currently houses nine species of corals from several bodies of water (Gulf of Mexico/Caribbean, Atlantic, and Hawaiian/Pacific). The goal of our research group is to increase the genetic diversity of threatened and endangered coral species by collaborating with other state and federal, and academic institutions to increase genetic representation and restoration potential. Of the nine species of corals we house:

1. _Acropora cervicornis_ (ACER:Caribbean)
2. _Orbicella faveolata_ (OFAV:Caribbean)
3. _Siderastrea sidera_ (SSID:Caribbean)
4. _Soleanatsrea intersepta_ (SINT:Caribbean)
5. _Montastrea cavernosa_ (MCAV:Caribbean)
6. _Scolymia cubensis_ (SCUB:Caribbean)
7. _Phyllangia americana_ (PAME:Caribbean) 
8. _Agaricia sp._ (AGAR:Caribbean)
9. _Montipora capitata_ (Pacific)
10. _Pocillopora acuta_ (Pacific)
11. _Porites compresa_ (Pacific)
12. _Fungia sp._ (Pacific)
